# Alu Dark - PyCharm High Contrast 

## Theme for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

The mission of this theme is to mimic PyCharm High Contrast theme interface. 

Code colours are also my historical setup from a chain of IDEs I worked before and tried to transfer my colours 
as I change the IDE. 

This theme is tailored for Python but it should look nice in other languages as well.

Any Issues, PRs, Suggestions are welcome.
